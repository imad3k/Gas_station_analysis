<h1> Simple Visualization of my Gas Station Data (2016-2019) </h1>

Hey all, this notebook is exploring a small gas station data set. Please check it a out here (https://github.com/imad3k/Gas_station_analysis/blob/main/c_store_test.ipynb).

The Jupyter notebook was made using Google's colab. For the charts I used the Seaborn library.
